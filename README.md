HireSight â€“ Smart Job Application Tracker

HireSight helps job seekers stay on top of their applications by unifying data from Gmail and manual entries into a single dashboard.
It tracks application statuses (applied, rejected, in-progress) and gives users clarity on where they stand.
Future versions will include an AI-driven predictor to estimate the chances of advancing in the hiring process.
